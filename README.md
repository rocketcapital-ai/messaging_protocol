# Overview
This is an implementation of the messaging protocol described in the paper

# Setup

This project uses the [`eth-brownie`](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework for interacting and/or simulating blockchain interactions.

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create or import wallets into brownie.
```bash
brownie accounts generate <account_name>
```
or
 ```bash
 brownie accounts new <account_name>
 ```

## Running the development script
You will need to populate the entries in `main.py` inside the arrow brackets with the appropriate values. These specify the name of your brownie wallet created above, as well as the path to the public and private key `.pem` files.

If needed, generate keys via the `generate_key_pair` function in `core_tools/tools.py`.

You will need 2 accounts, 1 for the user making the request and 1 for the user responding to the request. Accordingly, you will also need 2 sets of public-private key pairs.

This script uses IPFS via the Pinata API. Obtain a JWT from [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) and paste it into the `JWT` field in the `cfg.yml` file.

Then, run:
```bash
brownie run scripts/main.py -I
```
(`-I` flag is for interactive mode, which allows you to interact with the blockchain after the script is run.)

This script makes 1 iteration of the messaging protocol. 

### Send Request
- A generates a request (a csv file) and a symmetric key.
- A encrypts the request with the symmetric key and pins it to IPFS, obtaining a file reference.
- A encrypts the symmetric key with B's public key.
- A hashes the request, and signs this hash with A's private key.
- A register the file reference to the encrypted request, the encrypted symmetric key and the signature, along with B's wallet address as a REQUEST on the `Messaging` smart contract.

### Receive Request
- B checks the `Messaging` smart contract for pending requests.
- B retrieves the file reference to the encrypted request, the encrypted symmetric key and the signature from the `Messaging` smart contract.
- B decrypts the symmetric key with B's private key.
- B retrieves the encrypted request from IPFS using the file reference.
- B decrypts the request with the symmetric key.
- B hashes the request and verifies the signature with A's wallet address.

### Send Response
- B generates a response (a csv file) and a symmetric key.
- B encrypts the response with the symmetric key and pins it to IPFS, obtaining a file reference.
- B encrypts the symmetric key with A's public key.
- B hashes the response, and signs this hash with B's private key.
- B registers the file reference to the encrypted response, the encrypted symmetric key and the signature, along with A's wallet address and the message id of the original REQUEST from A as a RESPONSE on the `Messaging` smart contract.

### Receive Response
- A checks the `Messaging` smart contract for pending responses to the original REQUEST.
- A retrieves the file reference to the encrypted response, the encrypted symmetric key and the signature from the `Messaging` smart contract.
- A decrypts the symmetric key with A's private key.
- A retrieves the encrypted response from IPFS using the file reference.
- A decrypts the response with the symmetric key.
- A hashes the response and verifies the signature with B's wallet address.

### Publishing Symmetric Encryption Keys
- A and B both publish their unencrypted symmetric keys for the request and response respectively to the `Messaging` smart contract. This is to demonstrate the ability to allow any member of the public to verify the contents of the original request and original response at a later time.
